            The Scribe team will do our best to address your contribution as soon as we can. The following is a checklist for maintainers to make sure this process goes as well as possible. Feel free to address the points below yourself in further commits if you realize that actions are needed :)

            If you're not already a member of our [public Matrix community](https://matrix.to/#/#scribe_community:matrix.org), please consider joining! We'd suggest using [Element](https://element.io/) as your Matrix client, and definitely join the General and Data rooms once you're in. Also consider joining our [bi-weekly Saturday dev syncs](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/scribe-dev-sync). It'd be great to have you!
