    Split forms into groups of up to six forms per query based on identifiers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    language_entry : dict
        Dictionary containing language data with missing features.

    output_dir : str or Path
        Directory where generated query files should be saved.

    sub_lang_iso_code : str, optional
        ISO code for sub-language if applicable.

    Notes
    -----
    Groups forms based on their identifiers to avoid generating too many queries.
    Combines small groups when possible to reduce the number of query files.
