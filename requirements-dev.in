# In order to add, delete or modify a dependency, please update
# the reference here and then run the following:
#
# - pip-compile --rebuild requirements.in
# - pip-compile --rebuild requirements-dev.in
#
# To update dependencies, please run the following in the project root:
# - pip-compile --upgrade requirements.in
# - pip-compile --upgrade requirements-dev.in
#
# Make sure we use production deps for constraining installed dev packages. This
# is important as otherwise we could be running tests with different versions
# than production.
