# Changelog

See the [releases for Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/releases) for an up to date list of versions and their release dates.

Scribe-Data tries to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version where increments are made of the:

- MAJOR version when we make incompatible API changes
- MINOR version when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- PATCH version when we make backwards compatible bug fixes

Emojis for the following are chosen based on [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/).

### ♻️ Code Refactoring

- `word_type` has been switched to `data_type` throughout the codebase ([#160](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/160)).
- Case, gender and annotation utility functions were removed as the formatting process that used them has changed.
- The SPARQLWrapper access method has been extracted to the Wikidata utils and is imported into the files that need it ([#164](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/164)).
- Export data paths have been converted to centrally saved variables to reduce hard coded string repetition.
- Many files were renamed including `update_data.py` being renamed `query_data.py`
- Paths within the package have been updated to work for all operating systems via `pathlib` ([#125](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/125)).
- The language formatting scripts have been dramatically simplified given changes to export paths all being the same.
- The `update_files` directory was removed in preparation of other means of showing data totals.
- The `language_data_extraction` directory was moved under the Wikidata directory as it's only used for those processes now ([#446](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/446)).
- The emoji keyword process was centralized to simplify project maintenance ([#359](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/359)).
- PyICU was removed as a dependency and a process was made to install it and its needed dependencies given the operating system of the user ([#196](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/196)).
- The data formatting step was centralized such that we only have one for all languages ([#142](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/142)).
- Sub-query processes are now no longer hard coded such that we'd need to maintain the total possible sub-queries within the `query_data.py` process.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

- Annotation bugs were removed like repeat or empty values.
- Perfect tenses of Portuguese verbs were fixed via finding the appropriate PID ([#68](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/68)).

- The `_update_files` directory was renamed `update_files` as these files are used in non-internal manners now ([#57](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/57)).
- A common function has been created to map Wikidata ids to noun genders ([#69](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/69)).
- The project now is installed locally for development and command line usage, so usages of `sys.path` have been removed from files ([#122](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/122)).
- The directory structure has been dramatically streamlined and includes folders for future projects where language data could come from other sources like Wiktionary ([#139](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/139)).
  - Translation files are moved to their own directory.
  - The `extract_transform` directory has been removed and all files within it have been moved one level up.
  - The `languages` directory has been renamed `language_data_extraction`.
  - All files within `wikidata/_resources` have been moved to the `resources` directory.
  - The gender and case annotations for data formatting have now been commonly defined.
  - All language directory `formatted_data` files have been now moved to the `scribe_data_json_export` directory to prepare for outputs being required to be directed to a directory outside of the package.

  - Formatting scripts have been written to prepare the queried data and load it into an SQLite database.
- The data update process has been cleaned up in preparation for future changes to Scribe-Data and to implement better practices.
- Language data was extracted into a JSON file for more succinct referencing ([#52](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/52)).
- Language codes are now checked with the package [langcodes](https://github.com/rspeer/langcodes) for easier expansion.
- A process has been created to check and update words that can be translated for each Scribe language ([#44](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/44)).

## Scribe-Data 3.1.0

### ✨ Features

- The word "Scribe" is now added to language database nouns files if it's not already present ([#35](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/35)).
- German contracted prepositions have been added to the German prepositions formatting process ([#34](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/34)).
- Words that are upper case are now better included in the autocomplete lexicon with their lower case equivalents being removed.
- Words with apostrophes have been removed from the autocomplete lexicon.

### ♻️ Code Refactoring

- Database output column names are now zero indexed to better align with Python and other language standards.

## Scribe-Data 3.0.0

### ✨ Features

- Scribe-Data now has the ability to generate SQLite databases from formatted language data.
  - `data_to_sqlite.py` is used to read available JSON files and input their information into the databases.
- These databases are now sent to Scribe apps via defined paths.
  - `send_dbs_to_scribe.py` finds all available language databases and copies them.
  - Separating this step from the data update is in preparation for data import in the future where this will be an individual step.
- Scribe-Data now also creates autocomplete lexicons for each language within `data_to_sqlite.py`.
- JSON data is no longer able to be uploaded to Scribe app directories directly, with the SQLite directories now being exported instead.
- Emojis of singular nouns are now also linked to their plural counterparts if the plural isn't present in the emoji keyword outputs.
- The emoji process also now updates a column to the `data_table.txt` file for sharing on readmes with `update_data.py` maintaining it in the data update process.

### ♻️ Code Refactoring

- The Jupyter notebooks for autosuggestions and emojis as well as `update_data.py` were moved to the `extract_transform` directory given that they're not used to load data anymore.
  - Their code was refactored to reflect their new locations.
- Massive amounts of refactoring happened to achieve the shift in the data export method:
  - `format_WORD_TYPE.py` files export to a `formatted_data` directory within `extract_transform`.
  - Copies of all data JSONs that were originally in Scribe apps are now in the `formatted_data` directories.
  - Functions in `update_utils.py` were switched given that data is no longer uploaded into a `Data` directory within the language keyboard directories within Scribe apps.
  - Lots of functions and variables were renamed to make them more understandable.
  - Code to derive appropriate export locations within `format_WORD_TYPE.py` files was removed in favor of a language `formatted_data` directory.
  - regex was added as a dependency.
  - pylint comments were removed.
- Verb SPARQL query scripts for Spanish and Italian were simplified to remove unneeded repeat conditions ([#7](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/7)).

### ✨ Features

- Scribe-Data now has the ability to download Wikipedia dumps of any language ([#15](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/15)).
- Functions have been added to parse and clean the above dumps ([#15](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/15)).
- Autosuggestions are generated from the cleaned texts by deriving most common words and those words that most commonly follow them ([#15](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/15)).
- A query for profane words has been added and integrated into the autosuggest flow to make sure that inappropriate words are not included ([#16](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/16)).
  - The adjectives column has been removed from Scribe data tables until support is offered.

### ♻️ Code Refactoring
