   * `Python getting started resources <https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/>`_

.. _dev-env:

Development environment
-----------------------

.. important::

   **Suggested IDE extensions**

   VS Code:

   * `blokhinnv.wikidataqidlabels <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blokhinnv.wikidataqidlabels>`_
   * `charliermarsh.ruff <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff>`_
   * `qwtel.sqlite-viewer <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qwtel.sqlite-viewer>`_
   * `streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker>`_

The development environment for Scribe-Data can be installed via the following steps:

1. `Fork <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>`_ the `Scribe-Data repo <https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data>`_, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

.. note::
   **Consider using SSH**

   Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below, consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.

   To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the HTTPS URL, ``https://github.com/...``, with the SSH one, ``git@github.com:...``.

   * e.g. Cloning now becomes ``git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/Scribe-Data.git``

   GitHub also has their documentation on how to `Generate a new SSH key <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent>`_ 🔑

.. code-block:: bash

    # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Scribe-Data.git
    # Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
    cd Scribe-Data
    # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data.git

* Now, if you run ``git remote -v`` you should see two remote repositories named:
    * ``origin`` (forked repository)
    * ``upstream`` (Scribe-Data repository)

2. Create a virtual environment for Scribe-Data (Python ``>=3.12``), activate it and install dependencies:

.. note::
   First, install ``uv`` if you don't already have it by following the `official installation guide <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    uv sync --all-extras  # create .venv and install all dependencies from uv.lock

    # Unix or macOS:
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Windows:
    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # .venv\Scripts\activate.ps1 (PowerShell)

After activating the virtual environment, set up `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    pre-commit install
    # uv run pre-commit run --all-files  # lint and fix common problems in the codebase

.. note::
   If you change dependencies in ``pyproject.toml``, regenerate the lock file with the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      uv lock  # refresh uv.lock for reproducible installs

.. note::
   If you are having issues with pre-commit and want to send along your changes regardless, you can ignore the pre-commit hooks via the following:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git commit --no-verify -m "COMMIT_MESSAGE"

If you face any issues, consider reinstalling Scribe-data by running the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install the new version of Scribe-Data:
    pip uninstall scribe-data
    pip install -e .  # or pip install scribe-data

    # Update the entry_points and console_scripts:
    python setup.py egg_info

.. note::
   Feel free to contact the team in the `Data room on Matrix <https://matrix.to/#/#ScribeData:matrix.org>`_ if you're having problems getting your environment setup!

.. _testing:

Testing
-------

In addition to the `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ hooks that are set up during the `Development environment`_ section, Scribe-Data also includes a testing suite that should be ran before all pull requests and subsequent commits. Please run the following in the project root:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest

.. _issues-projects:

Issues and projects
-------------------

The `issue tracker for Scribe-Data <https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues>`_ is the preferred channel for `Bug reports`_, `Feature requests`_ and `Pull requests`_. Scribe also organizes related issues into `projects <https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/projects>`_.

.. note::
   Just because an issue is assigned on GitHub doesn't mean the team isn't open to your contribution! Feel free to write `in the issues <https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues>`_ and we can potentially reassign it to you.

Be sure to check the ``-next release-`` and ``-priority-`` labels in the `issues <https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues>`_ for those that are most important, as well as those marked `good first issue <https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22>`_ that are tailored for first-time contributors.

.. _bug-reports:

Bug reports
-----------

A bug is a *demonstrable problem* that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** to check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** by trying to reproduce it using the latest ``main`` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** to make sure that the code in the repository is *definitely* responsible for the issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

* A quick summary
* Steps to reproduce
* What you expected would happen
* What actually happens
* Notes (why this might be happening, things tried that didn't work, etc)

To make the above steps easier, the Scribe team asks that contributors report bugs using the `bug report template <https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=bug_report.yml>`_, with these issues further being marked with the `Bug <https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20type%3ABug>`_ type.

Again, thank you for your time in reporting issues!

.. _feature-requests:

Feature requests
----------------

Feature requests are more than welcome! Please take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. When making a suggestion, provide as much detail and context as possible, and further make clear the degree to which you would like to contribute in its development. Feature requests are marked with the `Feature <https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20type%3AFeature>`_ type, and can be made using the `feature request <https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=feature_request.yml>`_ template.

.. _pull-requests:

Pull requests
-------------

Good pull requests - patches, improvements and new features - are the foundation of our community making Scribe-Data. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits. Note that all contributions to this project will be made under `the specified license <https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/blob/main/LICENSE.txt>`_ and should follow the coding indentation and style standards (`contact us <https://matrix.to/#/#scribe_community:matrix.org>`_ if unsure).

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (implementing features, refactoring code, etc), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the developers might not want to merge into the project. With that being said, major additions are very appreciated!

When making a contribution, adhering to the `GitHub flow <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html>`_ process is the best way to get your work merged:

1. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git checkout <dev-branch>
      git pull upstream <dev-branch>

2. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>

3. Commit your changes in logical chunks, and please try to adhere to `Conventional Commits <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>`_.

.. note::
   The following are tools and methods to help you write good commit messages ✨

   * `commitlint <https://commitlint.io/>`_ helps write `Conventional Commits <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>`_
   * Git's `interactive rebase <https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/about-git-rebase>`_ cleans up commits

4. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git pull --rebase upstream <dev-branch>

5. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git push origin <topic-branch-name>

6. `Open a Pull Request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/>`_ with a clear title and description.

Thank you in advance for your contributions!

.. _data-edits:

Data edits
----------

.. note::
   Please see the `Wikidata and Scribe Guide <https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/blob/main/WIKIDATAGUIDE.md>`_ for an overview of `Wikidata <https://www.wikidata.org/>`_ and how Scribe uses it.

Scribe does not accept direct edits to the grammar JSON files as they are sourced from `Wikidata <https://www.wikidata.org/>`_. Edits can be discussed and the `Scribe-Data <https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data>`_ queries will be changed and ran before an update. If there is a problem with one of the files, then the fix should be made on `Wikidata <https://www.wikidata.org/>`_ and not on Scribe. Feel free to let us know that edits have been made by `opening an issue <https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues>`_ and we'll be happy to integrate them!

.. _documentation:

Documentation
-------------

The documentation for Scribe-Data can be found at `scribe-data.readthedocs.io <https://scribe-data.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. Documentation is an invaluable way to contribute to coding projects as it allows others to more easily understand the project structure and contribute. Issues related to documentation are marked with the `documentation <https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/labels/documentation>`_ label.

Function Docstrings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scribe-Data generally follows `numpydoc conventions <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_ for documenting functions and Python code in general. Function docstrings should have the following format:

.. code-block:: python

    def example_function(argument: argument_type) -> return_type:
        """
        An example docstring for a function so others understand your work.

        Parameters
        ----------
        argument : argument_type
            Description of your argument.

        Returns
        -------
        return_value : return_type
            Description of your return value.

        Raises
        ------
        ErrorType
            Description of the error and the condition that raises it.
        """

        ...

        return return_value

Building the Docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following commands to build the documentation locally:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd docs
    make html

You can then open ``index.html`` within ``docs/build/html`` to check the local version of the documentation.
